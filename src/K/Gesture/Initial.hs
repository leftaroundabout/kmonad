-- basic types -----------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Either an 'On' or an 'Off' around some type
data Toggle a = On a | Off a
  deriving (Eq, Show, Functor, Foldable, Traversable)

-- | Alias for a list of 'Toggle' of some type
type Toggles a = [Toggle a]

-- | A lens into the i
tag :: Lens' (Toggle a) a
tag = lens get set
  where get (On x)    = x
        get (Off x)   = x
        set (On _) x  = On x
        set (Off _) x = Off x

-- | A sequence of 'On' and 'Off' toggles guaranteed to follow these constraints:
--
-- 1. 'On' and 'Off' 'Toggle's for any value of 'a' always alternate
-- 2. The first (and therefore any odd) occurence for any 'a' is always 'On'
-- 3. The last occurence for any 'a' is always 'Off'
--
-- 'Gesture' was inspired by how people interact with a keyboard: you start with
-- none of the keys pressed, then you express a gesture by pressing and
-- releasing keys in some pattern, and you end your gesture with all keys
-- released again.
--
-- NOTE: It might be interesting to note that any gesture that actually follows
-- these rules can be modelled without the use of 'Toggle', all odd occurences
-- of some value are guaranteed to be presses, and all even occurences are
-- guaranteed to be releases.
--
-- NOTE: Gesture is not a Functor. An arbitrary transformation of @a -> b@ could
-- turn different @a@s into the same @b@, causing a 'Gesture' to break its
-- alternation law. The only way to fmap a 'Gesture' is with an isomorphism.

-- | A subsection of a 'Gesture'
--
-- This type keeps the rule of alternation, but relaxes the 2nd and 3d rules
-- about starting and ending in the empty-state. It therefore expresses
-- subsections of a 'Gesture'.
--
-- NOTE: It might be interesting to note that, etymologically, /suggestion/
-- comes from /sub/ + /gerere/, the latter also being the root of /gesture/.
-- Another name for 'Subgest' might therefore be 'Suggestion'.

{- This might be hard to follow, so let me explain the calculation carefully:

We receive a sequence of toggles, and are going to move through them one by one,
making a decision at every step to throw an error or manipulate some state.

We keep track of 2 sets: the set of currently pressed elements, and the set of
elements that must have been pressed before we got this sequence, otherwise
there would be 2 offs in a row. E.g. if a sequence starts with 'Off 1', then
that sequence only makes sense in the context of '1' already having been pressed.

So: if we get an On we add it to our pressed set, if it's already there, that
means an on-twice error. If we get an Off, if it's pressed, we just unpress it.
If its unpressed we try to add it to our initial context, if it's already there,
that's an Off-Twice error.

{- | TODO: insert header

The 'K.Shell.Cfg' submodule contains all of the abstractions that deal with
specifying and applying modifications to KMonad's behavior. Dependency-wise,
this should be the second-most primal submodule of 'K.Shell'. I.e., it may
depend on 'K.Shell.Initial', but on nothing else.

There was the option of leaving functionality-specific configuration as part of
that functionality's module (e.g., 'LogCfg' in the 'K.Shell.Logging' submodule).
The decision to centralize all configuration was deliberate: having it all part
of 1 file helps me maintain overview.
